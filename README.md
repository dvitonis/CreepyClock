Creepy Clock
======

It watches you.
It knows when you watch it.

Creepy Clock displays the time only when someone is looking at it.
It looks for faces in the steam from the camera.

## Featured Bugs
It is so creepy that it continues watching you even after you shut it down
(just kill it via Task Manager, until the issue is addressed in the framework).
